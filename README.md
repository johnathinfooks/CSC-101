Message Flagger Program!

#######################################################

We will be parsing through a history of messages sent that correspond with a user. Examples include GroupMe, Discord, Slack, or other popular messaging sites where multiplp eusers communicate.

The program will be able to flag a user in a history of messages sent in a channel if said user has been dangerous. It will also give a judgement that can be calibrated about how bad the activity is. All of this analysis will be intuitive to interact with as a user.
